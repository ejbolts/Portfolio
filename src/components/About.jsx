          I have a strong foundation in web development, with a particular focus
          on designing full-stack applications. I have experience with React,
          Angular, NodeJS, TypeScript, Python, AWS and much more. I have a deep
          understanding of the core elements of software engineering, such as
          data structures and algorithms, and I am a team player who enjoys
          collaborating with others to create innovative and engaging
          applications.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          To showcase my skills and experiences, I have created this portfolio
          website that includes details about my projects and interests.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          In addition to my academic studies, I am also looking to gain
          practical experience. I have worked in the retail industry for several
          years, and I have developed strong communication and interpersonal
          skills. I am eager to apply these skills in a professional setting,
          and I am excited about the opportunity to learn from experienced
          professionals and contribute to a dynamic and innovative organisation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          For my future professional career, I plan to have a position as a
          full-stack software engineer at a reputable company where I can
          continue to learn new skills and make a meaningful contribution to the
          organisation. I am motivated to improve my skills and knowledge, and I
          am looking forward to joining a team that shares my passion for
          software development and innovation.

        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          In my free time, I enjoy staying active and healthy by going to the
          gym. I have been going consistently for six plus years and have built
          up a good level of strength, fitness and discipline. I also enjoy
          gaming on PC and console. I like a wide variety of game genres so no
          particular favourites haha. I also enjoy listening to EDM and Rock
          music to get me hyped up.
