          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          My name is Ethan and I am currently in my third year studying software
          engineering at Griffith University. I am fascinated by how software
          technologies are used in the industry to further our technological
          growth worldwide, and I love learning about the latest developments
          and how they will impact our world going forward.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          I have a strong foundation in web development, with a particular focus
          on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have also gained some experience with
          the React framework and have a basic knowledge of Python. I have a
          deep understanding of the core elements of software engineering, such
          as data structures and algorithms, and I am a team player who enjoys
          collaborating with others to create innovative and engaging
          applications.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          To showcase my skills and experiences, I have created this portfolio
          website that includes details about my projects and interests.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          In addition to my academic studies, I am also looking to gain
          practical experience through an internship. I have worked in the
          retail industry for several years, and I have developed strong
          communication and interpersonal skills. I am eager to apply these
          skills in a professional setting, and I am excited about the
          opportunity to learn from experienced professionals and contribute to
          a dynamic and innovative organisation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          For my future professional career, I plan to have a position as a
          full-stack software engineer at a reputable company where I can
          continue to learn new skills and make a meaningful contribution to the
          organisation. I am motivated to improve my skills and knowledge, and I
          am looking forward to joining a team that shares my passion for
          software development and innovation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          In my free time, I enjoy staying active and healthy by going to the
          gym. I have been going consistently for four years and have built up a
          good level of strength, fitness and discipline. I also enjoy gaming on
          PC and console. I like a wide variety of game genres so no particular
          favourites. I also enjoy listening to EDM and Rock music.
